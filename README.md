# MegaCities GeoJSON Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use GeoJSON data with Esri's JavaScript API to visualize geographic information on a web map. The project includes an HTML file and a GeoJSON file that are hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that sets up the web map and loads the GeoJSON data.
- **MegaCities.geojson**: The GeoJSON file containing geographic data about mega cities.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## GeoJSON
GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It is widely used for sharing geographic data on the web. In this project, the `MegaCities.geojson` file contains data about various mega cities around the world.

## Esri JavaScript API
The Esri JavaScript API allows developers to create interactive maps and perform spatial analysis in web applications. This project uses the API to load and display the GeoJSON data on a basemap.

## Instructions
1. **Study the Developer Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the Esri JavaScript API by reading the [developer documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/layers-geojson/).

2. **Sample Code**: Review the sample code provided by Esri in their [sandbox environment](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/sandbox/?sample=layers-geojson).

3. **Modify Boilerplate Code**: Use the boilerplate code from "Hello esri.js!" and modify it to load and display the `MegaCities.geojson` file.

4. **Host on GitHub Pages**: Host the `index.html` file and `MegaCities.geojson` on GitHub Pages.

## Conclusion
This project provides a practical example of how to use GeoJSON data with the Esri JavaScript API to create interactive web maps. By following the instructions and utilizing the provided resources, you will be able to visualize geographic data on a web map hosted on GitHub Pages.
